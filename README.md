Hi, Iâ€™m Ossama Obeid, a Reasearch Associate at New York University Abu Dhabi.

I currently work on Arabic Natural Language Processing at [CAMeL Lab](http://camel-lab.com/), primarily maintaining [CAMeL Tools](https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/camel_tools) among other things. 

I'm also dabbling with game development in Unity as well as learning Rust.
